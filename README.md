# War never changes - Source code

This is the source code for the jam game "[War never changes](https://timm638.itch.io/war-never-changes)", which as been developed as part of the Regensburg Summer Game Jam 2025 in 48 hours. It should be noted, that the focus in that time lied on the end product and not the cleanliness of the code or art assets. :D

War never changes is a auto-battler, where your goal is to keep the war between two sides going by using god-like powers. 

## Installation

Pull the repo with `git clone` and open the folder with Godot 4.4.1.
